Abstract:

A web based collaborative document sharing and editing system, similar to
Wikipedia. The idea is to create a note sharing webapp that allows for experts
on a topic to create a page and accept contributions to it from students who
have knowledge on the topic. Changes are queued and then added to the page when
they are approved by the page owner. Ideally this will be implemented through
diffing the changes and storing deltas, if time allows us to accomplish this.
The webapp will implement a search feature, viewable user profile page,
page ratings, comments, and more.

Installing:
 - Install latest apache, mysql, php5 and apache module, php5-mysqlnd.
 - git clone https://github.com/gundermanc/eecs341-cms.git
